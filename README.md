# Generative Snake Show
 An arduino project that utilizes a 32x32 board of multicolor LEDs. The parameters of up to 4 "brushes" are randomly set, and then each brush follows a few simple movement rules. Brushes are then mirrored or rotated to the other 4 quadrants of the board, creating interesting colorful patterns.
